# Logos

The logos are placed into two categories: `light_text` and `dark_text`. Use `light_text` when using the logo on dark backgrounds, and `dark_text` on light backgrounds. 

### Terminology:
- **The "Mark"**: the "P" part of the logo. This should be rarely be used outside of social media account profile pictures.
- **The "Lockup"**: the combination of the Mark on top of the word "PALMER."
- **The "Escher"**: special versions of the light mark and lockup with added gradients and shading. Use this wherever possible. Only use this on top dark backgrounds.
