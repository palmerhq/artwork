# Logos

This directory is structured into three main folders: `light_text`, `dark_text`, and `vector`. Use `light_text` when using the logo on dark backgrounds, and `dark_text` on light backgrounds. 
Additionally, black and white and color versions of the artwork can be found in `dark_text/alternatives` and `light_text/alternatives` folders.

### Terminology:
- **The "Mark"**: the "P" part of the logo. This should be rarely be used outside of social media account profile pictures.
- **The "Lockup"**: the combination of the Mark on top of the word "PALMER."
- **The "Escher"**: special versions of the light mark and lockup with added gradients and shading. Use this wherever possible. Only use this on top dark backgrounds.
